    EFFEKTIV is an international brand, the manufacturer of household appliances and professional equipment based in
    Dublin (Ireland). Its history began back in 2012.
    <br><br>
    So far we have been proud of developing and manufacturing truly efficient equipment of unprecedented high quality at
    really affordable prices.
    <br>
    Due to different tendencies of reducing the production costs followed by a subsequent reduction in the cost of
    production, cost-effective household and professional appliances are strictly and justly associated with reduced
    quality and comfort of use in the modern world.
    <br><br>
    The initial goal and mission of our team were to turn this concept upside-down, providing the buyer with exceptional
    quality with unprecedented professional-level operating efficiency at a comfortable and affordable price. We still
    maintain our position.
</p>
<p>The branch offices are located in Western Europe (Spain, Ireland), Eastern Europe (Hungary, Moscow), and Southeast
    Asia (Hong Kong).</p>
<p>The product categories that we manufacture are represented by useful household appliances such as ironing, sewing,
    and cleaning. These are steamers, ironing steam generators, steam cleaners, robotic vacuum cleaners, cyclonic vacuum
    cleaners, cordless vacuum cleaners, sewing and embroidery machines, overlocks, and related accessories and
    consumables.</p>
